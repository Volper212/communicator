# communicator
A simple WebSocket chat made using PHP.
## Usage
Run `php server.php` in the command line and change the `ip.txt` file with the IP address of the machine you ran the command in. Then with the server running, host the folder locally and open it in your browser. If you choose to host the chat, make sure to do it using raw `http://`.
